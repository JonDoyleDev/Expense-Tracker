## Background

Thanks for checking out my repo! I'm Jon, an aspiring web developer from Denver Colorado. This project was made following the tutorial in the link below, and then I added some very basic animations, as well as the github link to this repository. The objective with this exercise was to refresh and further my understanding of the JavaScript fundamentals.
